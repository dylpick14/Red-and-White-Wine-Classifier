# Red-and-White-Wine-Classifier

This project uses python and Machine Learning to classify whether or not a wine is red wine or white wine based upon its features such as:
alcohol %
PH
density
acidity (in various forms)
sulfates
quality

The Machine Learning Models used were:
Support Vector Classification
K-Nearest Neighbor
Linear Support Vector 

The program will train based on 80% of the data in the wine_data.csv file and predict what type of wine it is with the remaining 20%
of the data. It will print out the results by telling the user how accurate each model was. It is supposed to print out a confusion matrix for the information, however, this does not always work.
